<p>HTML4 vs HTML5<p>
             <p>HTML4 has been a standard web development for more than 10 years. HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language and is more flexible, robust and advanced as compare to its older counterpart. Cascading style sheets (CSS) is the visual language of the web, controlling everything visual about a website. With its newest version, CSS3, its evolved to do even more.</p>
             <p>HTML5 and CSS3:</p>
             <ol><li>1. The DOCTYPE declaration for HTML5 is very simplified: !DOCTYPE html</li>
<li>2. The character encoding declaration is also very simple:
    meta charset="UTF-8"</li>
                 <li>3. New Structural Elements that allow screen readers to easily access content and better examine the HTML. </li>
                 <li>	4. Multimedia Elements including video and audio tags. On my website I used video, audio and embedded my youtube video. The biggest struggle here was realizing that my video added by video tag would take forever to load. Uploading it on youtube and embedding it solved the problem.</li>
                 <li>5. Better Interactions provided by canvas (used in costumiser) and drag and drop (used in shopping cart).</li>
                 <li>6. Responsive Design and meta tags such as Viewport, that allows to define viewport widths and zoom settings </li>
                 <li>7. Accessing User Geographical location is very easy.</li>
                 <li>8. Mobile-first mentality. CSS3 inherently supports responsive design, and is equipped to handle media queries. Media queries are calls made by the code to determine what device and size screen a user is viewing the site on. In our times when almost everyone uses mobile phones responsive design became a very important part of web authoring. CSS3 made it easy to design for other devices such as phones or tablets. </li>
                 <li>9. Text effects: CSS3 includes shadow effects, text overflow (which hides text that gets too long for its element), word breaking (automatically breaking text so it fits within a box), and text wrappingall things that save designers lots of formatting time.</li>
             </ol>
             <h2>Best Practice</h2>
             <p>Starting my website at the beginning of Semester A I had no knowledge in terms of html, css, js and jquery. At the beginning, to understand baisc web design I borrowed in University library HTML & CSS: design and build web sites recommended book by Jon Duckett. It was very helpful in understanding basic ideas for this module. As a Computer Scientist after reading the book I decided to broaden by horizons in the internet. W3Schools website, often recommended on web authoring labs, became my best friend, allowing me to learn on real examples. The last tool that had a huge impact on my progress with mark up by showing me my mistakes was W3C validator. </p>
             <p>I used best practise by checking every html and css in w3c validator</p>
             <p>My most common mistake was not adding alt attribute which displays text if image can not be displayed.  Putting my page on W3C validator I got scared seeing the amount of mistakes. Fortunately, adding alt fixed the problem. I understood how important alt is, because the user might get confused seeing blank spaces on the website.</p>

<p>Another mistake was replacing div with section. At first I did not really understand the difference in usage HTML5 New Structural Elements and started using section tag as a replacement for div. When W3C validator started requesting h2-h5 tags I understood my mistake and changed the tags for appropriate ones for each section, allowing screen readers to easily access content and better examine HTML.</p>

             <p>The third mistake was squeezing css elements into html file. Having no knowledge on proper web design I decided to put everything in one place, which resulted in very unclear html file and made inspecting website online a nightmare.Thanks to W3C validator, which suggested that style elements should be in css my html code is now clear and understandable.     </p>
             <p>Now my  HTML page is free from errors</p>
             <p>When it comes to CSS, w3c validator showed only one error which I did not understand how to fix. As I used same CSS in a couple of pages, the same error pops out. "@import can not appear after any of existing tags but for @charset and @import. @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300,400,600,700,800&subset=latin-ext")"</p>
            <p>I believe that anoter best pracitse was using HTML5 and CSS3, which provide user with best possible experience. On my website I used header, section, footer, nav, iframe, main, form and article. Unfortunately, but for new structural elements I still used many divs, which may disturb pages' clarity. At first I did not quite get the new structural elements and only during W3C validation I understood that it was a mistake to replace div with section. New web designers might consider it as HTML5 weakness that the code now has to be logically designed and named to fit new structural elements, which forces web designer to code more carefully and consciously. I also considered responsive design that allowes user to see my website on tablet and mobile phone.</p>
             <p>Last but not least, file organisation and naming was also considered:</p>
