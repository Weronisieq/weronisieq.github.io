Dear whoever reads it,
This website is my final project for website developement classes in computer science course at the University of Linoln in the UK.
It's my first project made with HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of jQuery.
The shop doesn't work perfectly, but hey, I only had like 4 months to learn all of this, so I believe I did quite well. 
My lecturer thinks the oppostie - I barely passed. 
Thanks for reading this,
It's 2017 by the way.
