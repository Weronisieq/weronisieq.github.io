# MyFirstWebsite
It's my first project made with HTML and CSS. I copies the jQuery/JS code from the net just to make the shop "work". The code isn't good but it shows my basic understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals. 
Learning outcomes:
[LO1] understand the strengths and weaknesses of current web specifications and standards over
previous version iterations.
[LO2] design and implement interactive web pages featuring multimedia, advanced interaction, and
local storage.
[LO3] apply appropriate web standards ensuring maximum interoperability.
