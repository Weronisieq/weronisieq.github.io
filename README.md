This website is my final project for website developement classes in the 1st semester of the computer science course at the University of Linoln in the UK. It's my first project made with HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of jQuery. 
The shop doesn't work perfectly - drag and drop works fine but items added to the basket don't remain in it after reloading. 
I like the style but I am aware that my code is spaghetti. 
I only had like 4 months to learn all of this, so I believe I did quite well. 
My lecturer thinks the oppostie - I barely passed. 
Thanks for reading this,
It's 2017 by the way.
